# CSU Atmos. Sci. Programmming Tutorials

The notebooks and scripts in this repository are meant to serve as tutorials to
introduce students to the basics of python, and scientific data analysis needed
to succeed both in their first year in the program and beyond.

This page is intentionally sparse as it is simply meant as a storage repo for
the resources contained within. A website/GitHub organization with more details
is currently forthcoming. When such a sit fully operational and set-up this
readme will be updated to link to that site/organization.
